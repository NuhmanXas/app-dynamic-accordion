# AppDynamicAccordion

## Description

`AppDynamicAccordion` is a dynamic accordion component for React applications, utilizing React-Bootstrap. It allows for the creation of accordion elements dynamically by passing an array of items, each with its own title and content. This component is ideal for situations where the accordion content needs to be generated programmatically or is subject to change.

## Installation

To use `AppDynamicAccordion` in your project, you need to have React and React-Bootstrap installed. If you haven't already installed these dependencies, you can do so by running the following commands:

```bash
npm install react react-dom
npm install react-bootstrap
```

After installing the necessary dependencies, you can install `AppDynamicAccordion` via npm:

```bash
npm install nmm-xas-app-dynamic-accordion
```

## Usage

To use `AppDynamicAccordion` in your React application, first import the component:

```jsx
import AppDynamicAccordion from 'nmm-xas-app-dynamic-accordion';
```

Then, you can use the `AppDynamicAccordion` component in your app by passing an array of objects as `accordionItems`. Each object should have a `title` and `content` property.

Here's an example of how to use `AppDynamicAccordion`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import AppDynamicAccordion from 'nmm-xas-app-dynamic-accordion';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const accordionData = [
    {
      title: 'Accordion Item #1',
      content: 'Content for the first item...'
    },
    {
      title: 'Accordion Item #2',
      content: 'Content for the second item...'
    },
    // Add more items as needed
  ];

  return <AppDynamicAccordion accordionItems={accordionData} />;
};

export default MyComponent;
```
